 Content for Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree curriculum, which includes project and lesson content.
 
 Data from Project 2 is too big to be uploaded on GitHub; it consisted of thousand of images of different categories of flowers, spread into training, validation and testing sets.
 
 Data for Project 3 (Unsupervised learning) is not made publicly available as per agreement with the company who provided it. The project consisted of applying KMeans clustering to data about the general population of Germany to identify segments in the population, and then comparing the distribution of the population across the clusters to that of clients of a mail-order company. The goal was to identify customer segments for said company, information that could be used, for example, to better target the right people in marketing campaigns. Since this was a real case study with real data, the company did not authorize us to keep the data.
