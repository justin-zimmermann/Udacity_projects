# Data Scientist Project

Project code for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program. In this project, we developped a code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.

In order to complete this project, we needed to use the GPU enabled workspaces within the classroom.

### Data

The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large we cannot upload it onto Github. We trained using 102 different types of flowers, where there are ~20 images per flower to train on.  Then we used our trained classifier to see if we could predict the type for new images of the flowers.
